<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This journey started one day when I decided that I was done living blindly in the age of artificial intelligence.
  I wanted to understand what makes up a software. From the beautiful UI designs, to the flow, to the full functionality
  of the software. I was intimidated at the begining, but after watching a few videos, I became totally intrigued. Now, Look!
  I just finished Beginner to Advanced HTML course and am on my way to becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer.

<p>I started out as a sales and customer service representative in 2013 "so why not learn how to sell digitally?" I 
  thought to myself" Then drifting began my journey into digital marketing with a course on Udemy in 2019. Did I mention
  that I was in the hospitality industry at the time? Yes, I got into the hospitality industry from 2018 to 2021. I bacame more
  confident selling digitally in 2022 and began UI/UX Design. I became a confident UI/UX Designer in year 2023 and that was when
  I began HTML.

<p>Soon I'll be creating amazing tools that will make our lives easier and boost productivity.</p>
